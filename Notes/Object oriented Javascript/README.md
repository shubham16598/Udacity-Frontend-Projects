object-oriented-js
==================

Notes and exercises from Udacity's [Object Oriented Javascript course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud015), organized by lesson. Each file contains code that students may run in the IDE of their choice to follow along with what the instructor is coding in the videos. Later lesson files also contain definitions and key points. (L1-2 are a bit skimpy -- feel free to submit pull requests to add content.)
